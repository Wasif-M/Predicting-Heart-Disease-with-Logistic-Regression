# Predicting-Heart-Disease-with-Logistic-Regression
This is a machine learning project that uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various physical features. The dataset used in this project contains information on patients such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.

The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on these physical features. The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
